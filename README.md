# Data Exploration with SQL 
1.  Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales of furniture products, grouped by each quarter of the year, and order the results chronologically.
2.  Analyse the impact of different discount levels on sales performance across product categories, specifically looking at the number of orders and total profit generated for each discount classification.
3.  Determine the top-performing product categories within each customer segment based on sales and profit, focusing on those categories that rank within the top two for profitability.
4.  Create a report that displays each employee's performance across different product categories, showing not only the total profit per category but also what percentage of their total profit each category represents, with the results ordered by the percentage in descending order for each employee.
5.  Develop a user-defined function in SQL Server to calculate the profitability ratio for each product category an employee has sold, then apply this function to generate a report that ranks each employee's product categories by their profitability ratio.
